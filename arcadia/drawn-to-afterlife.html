    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Thousands of years ago, the canvas of Spectradom was painted by the god of imagination, Celesta. The Three Sacred Treasures, the Drafting Pencil, Inking Pen, and Filling Brush are said to be relics from this time period. Each are associated with a certain species - sketches, figures, and kanvas.</p>

    <h2>Landmasses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Quillan: The northernomst landmass. It's known for a chilly climate thanks to the Inkwell Glacier, but as a result of the Tranquility Ocean to its west, Wassecola Bay and the Acrylla Archipelago are surprisingly moderate. It's named for the kingdom of Quill (Rokadong: Kuhilríkatanah <span class=rokadong-script>KuiHLIRKTN'</span>).</li>
      <li>Graphine: The central landmass. The islands to the north, like Matte Island and Haba Island, are generally considered part of Graphine as well. The Kingdom of Inspoll is very important in providing Graphine with a sense of peace, being the primary protector of the Habaneira Alliance, the largest international organization of Spectradom.</li>
      <li>Mangell: The eastern landmass. The Dishika Republic, whose territory is mostly in Debaz, is the most powerful country of Mangell, thanks in large part to their scientific prowess, but there are several other countries on the continent.</li>
      <li>North Gomensai: A landmass to the south. Most of its western half is under the control of the Fenril Federation, a massive empire whose capital is in the Wanderlust Desert (part of the Lust Dunes area).</li>
      <li>South Gomensai: The southern polar landmass, with some of the harshest weather in Spectradom. The Void Rim contains a couple colonies of the Fenril Federation, and the Sinner's Channel is said to be littered with the spirits of sea-faring Fenrilish. The rest of South Gomensai is generally referred to as "Far Gomensai" and has seen only extremely limited habitation for centuries. However, according to ancient Liðahjalan myth, across the ice of Far Gomensai is the land of the gods - a lush forest or otherwise relatively warm area, known in English as Primum Paradise. Interestingly, although Mangellian technology could allow them to cross the Ashen Ocean and reach Far Gomensai, storms have repeatedly stopped any sailors and forced them to turn back.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Sentient Species</h1>
    <h2>Sketches</h2>
    <div class=row>

      </div><div class="col col-66">
        <p>Sketches are, in effect, fae creatures. They are said to be the eldest of the three races to appear in Spectradom. Most take the appearance of humanoid elves or imp-like creatures. Their skin and hair colorations are similar in range to humans, though without the saturation.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Figures</h2>
    <div class=row>
      <div class="col col-33">
        <p><i>Example image coming soon</i></p>
      </div><div class="col col-66">
        <p>Figures, or stickfigures, as the name implies are effectively Spectradom's human-analogues, as they do not have the pointed ears of sketches.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Kanvas</h2>
    <div class=row>
      <div class="col col-33">
        <p><i>Example image coming soon</i></p>
      </div><div class="col col-66">
        <p>Kanvas are anthropomorphic creatures similar in appearance to canid and felid animals. They tend to have a monochromatic color scheme, though not gray like a sketch.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Quills and Shavings</h2>
    <div class=row>
      <div class="col col-33">
        <p><i>Example image coming soon</i></p>
      </div><div class="col col-66">
        <p>Quills and shavings are small fairy-like creatures that do not get along. Both are able to use magical spells without use of a swatch, though they use their energy to do so, and may vanish if they use too much. These are spirits, and one could think of them as manifestations of "matter" and "antimatter" of the imaginary plane, as their powers are equal and opposite.</p>
        <p>Quills are humanoids that often have animal features. They are connected to life, and their powers are strongest in places with more life energy, namely rainforests and temperate forests. Due to their animal features and sharing their natural swatch abilities, they're often associated with kanvas.</p>
        <p>Shavings are demon-like creatures connected to decay, similar in nature to zombies or vampires. Their powers are strongest in desert environments. They are parasitic, feeding on the life energy of other beings. A shaving may turn into an imprint by consuming an entire soul, which usually appears like a faded or miscolored variant of the original body.</p>
