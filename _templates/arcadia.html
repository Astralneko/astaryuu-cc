    <p>The homepage for all things Arcadia, my original world (universe? multiverse? cosmere? idk what to call it).</p>

    <p>Note: Although <a href="/fan_aus/deltarune/">Glitchrune</a> *is* a fandom piece, it utilizes Arcadian lore somewhat heavily.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Arcadia takes place across several different worlds, known as "gameworlds" for the sake of cosmology. All seven of these are "video games," fictional worlds to a super-dimension (the real world).</p>
    <p>This world is very personal to me, being the culmination of literally my entire art career, but that doesn't mean you can't create fan-content if you so desire. Just don't claim the things on this website as your own work and we're good.</p>

  <div class=textbo id="Outrealm"><div class=textbo-inner>
    <h2><a href="/arcadia/outrealm/">Outrealm</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2015, Outrealm was the first world I've created, and includes some of the first characters I've ever created. It's gone through some changes since then, but it's still somewhat recognizable, taking place on the landmass of Askara, separated into nine lands that are loosely connected in a government-supplementary structure much like the European Union. The name Outrealm refers to the inciting incident - a <a href="/ocs/or/alice">strange spirit from another dimension</a> (the Abyss connecting the gameworlds) falling to earth...and unfortunately, atop the town of Ashenville. Much to its detriment. Now known as the Ashenville Meteor incident, said spirit, <a href="/ocs/or/nyatna">an Avalonian soldier</a>, <a href="/ocs/or/yue">a Dokkalmian spy</a>, and <a href="/ocs/or/ceara">an Avalonian farmer</a> find themselves caught up in a political power play to find the Ashenville Meteor due to its intense energy signature promising much wealth.</p>

  <div class=textbo id="Snow Phoenix"><div class=textbo-inner>
    <h2><a href="/arcadia/snow-phoenix/">Snow Phoenix and the Slumbering Dragon</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2020, <a href="/ocs/sp/snow">Snow Phoenix</a> and the Slumbering Dragon is a would-be puzzle platformer that takes place on the suspiciously dragon-shaped land of Anima. Due to said resemblance, it is said that eons ago, a titanic sea dragon known as Ashtorra was put to rest by an old god, forming the Dragonspine Mountains that divide the lands of Al-Mahijo and Neverey. But these are just stories, right? <a href="/ocs/sp/peppermint">Nobody would be crazy enough to try and awaken said dragon, right...?</a> Now what's that <a href="/ocs/sp/machigai">strange mist</a>...</p>

  <div class=textbo id="Weapons of Mass Appeal"><div class=textbo-inner>
    <h2><a href="/arcadia/weapons-mass-appeal/">Weapons of Mass Appeal</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2022, Weapons of Mass Appeal is a would-be MMO that takes place on the titanic continent of Valkyrie (which is literally shaped like one, and may have been one in its past). Here, spirits run wild; advances in harnessing their power has resulted in a wave of tech known as "soul-smithing." Or maybe, these would-be spirits are signs of ancient technology...? Dig deeper to find out...</p>

  <div class=textbo id="Tachyon Force"><div class=textbo-inner>
    <h2><a href="/arcadia/tachyon-force/">Tachyon Force</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-atom"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2021, Tachyon Force is a would-be shooter game that takes place in a science-fiction Earth. Set in 2144, this world has become quite dystopic. Two corporations in particular, Red Orchid Market and Blue Angel Network, have become absurdly powerful, on the level of individual states, and alongside several other organizations, have caused the federal government of the United States to be more or less a formality. However, this lack of real power has resulted in a very large error: the city of Moradopolis has been claimed by both corporations, resulting in much strife. With Blue Angel reportedly having a brand-new technology under their belt, will they be able to beat back ROM, or will Red Orchid push BAN out of Iowa? Or, will this conflict come to a stalemate...?</p>

  <div class=textbo id="Drawn to AfterLife"><div class=textbo-inner>
    <h2><a href="/arcadia/drawn-to-afterlife/">Drawn to AfterLife</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-fire-flame-simple"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2021, Drawn to AfterLife takes place on the continent simply known as Spectradom, where four major powers find themselves in a tenuous peace. The theme for this world is art and artistry. It is far and away my most detailed world, and most of my <a href="/conlang">conlang</a> projects directly connect to DTAL. The name refers to <a href="/ocs/dtal/charon-hatena">two of the protagonists</a> being in a pseudo-dead state where one must be a spirit at all times, though for all the textbo team, DTAL's story is about getting a second chance at life in some way, while stopping the peace-threatening actions of <a href="/ocs/dtal/iris">one mad king</a>.</p>

  <div class=textbo id="National Mana League"><div class=textbo-inner>
    <h2><a href="/arcadia/national-mana-league/">National Mana League</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-fist"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2021 before being revamped in 2023, National Mana League takes place in a fictional version of Earth where magic exists, and some of the most skilled in it participate in a sport devoted to magical combat. This includes hunting and showing off their skills against "fiends", monsters from the underworld. However, there may be a conspiracy behind the scenes...</p>

  <div class=textbo id="Yokai City"><div class=textbo-inner>
    <h2><a href="/arcadia/yokai-city/">Yokai City</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-torii-gate"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2022, Yokai City takes place in the city of the same name, a city of spirits tucked away in a pocket dimension created by diviners centuries ago. Recently, humans have rediscovered the Yokai City, and have sent their scientists to investigate the strange creatures found within, creating many Experiments in the process. <a href="/ocs/ykc/akihari">One of them</a> escapes, however, and as a result, inadvertently teaches <a href="/ocs/ykc/aster">an innocent dragon</a> and their friends about the outside world...</p>
