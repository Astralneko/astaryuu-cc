    <p>The homepage for all things Lutera, my fandom world (universe? multiverse? cosmere? idk what to call it).</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Lutera and Laniakea are twin worlds, effectively. It's been worked on off-and-on since 2016, and was actually relevant for me getting into art in the first place.</p>
    <p>Below you will see the regions of Lutera. Each has its own homepage, especially Laniakea as it is so vast.</p>
{% endtextbox %}
  
  <div class=textbox id="Verela"><div class=textbox-inner>
    <h2><a href="/lutera/verela/">Verela</a> <i class="fas fa-droplet"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2016, Verela was the first fan region I created. It has seen a considerable revamp since it was first developed though, as in around 2021 I revived the Verela project for the purposes of making a fangame based on it.</p>
  </div></div>
  
  <div class=textbox id="Zantaru"><div class=textbox-inner>
    <h2><a href="/lutera/verela/">Zantaru</a> <i class="fas fa-mountain"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2017 or 2018, Zantaru was the second fan region I created. It has seen a considerable revamp since it was first developed though, as I stopped working on it and Verela in 2018 or 2019 due to stupid decisions, only to come back to both later on in 2021 or so.</p>
  </div></div>
  
  <div class=textbox id="Silati"><div class=textbox-inner>
    <h2><a href="/lutera/verela/">Silati</a> <i class="fas fa-sun"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2020, Silati was the fifth fan region I created. It was originally created during work on another region, Syraik, but has since subsumed Syraik's role in terms of development <s>since Texas's governor is an idiot</s>. Syraik, on the other hand, was also initially created in 2018.</p>
  </div></div>
  
  <div class=textbox id="Xureen"><div class=textbox-inner>
    <h2><a href="/lutera/verela/">Xureen</a> <i class="fas fa-gem"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2019, Xureen was the fourth fan region I created. It's the only one that hasn't had a significant revamp in its history (including Laniakea), as the idea of a Australia-based region entirely underground is just Too Cool.</p>
  </div></div>
  
  <div class=textbox id="Tzarin"><div class=textbox-inner>
    <h2><a href="/lutera/verela/">Tzarin</a> <i class="fas fa-volcano"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2022, Tzarin was the sixth fan region I created. The whole idea came from me wanting to make the Champion of this such region a superboss in my Verela-based fangame lmao.</p>
  </div></div>
  
  <div class=textbox id="Laniakea"><div class=textbox-inner>
    <h2><a href="/laniakea/">Laniakea</a> <i class="fas fa-volcano"></i></h2>
    <p>Initially created in 2017, before receiving a revamp in 2019, before receiving a revamp in 2020, before receiving a revamp in 2021, Laniakea is a Mystery Dungeon-esque world, albeit set in a somewhat modern society as compared to typical PMD fare.</p>
